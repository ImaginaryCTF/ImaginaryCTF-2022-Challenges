    "Well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres — oh, they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin! They'll shave your liver, squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast.",
    "Well, it's no wonder you don't have any friends.",
    "Ogres are like onions.",
    "Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy.",
    "There's a stack of freshly made waffles in the middle of the forest! Don't you find that a wee bit suspicious?",
    "What are you doing in my swamp!?",
    "Well my stomach aches and my palms just got sweaty, must be a high school.",
    "Someday, I will repay you. Unless, of course, I can't find you. Or I forget.",
    "After a while, you learn to ignore the names people call you and just trust who you are.",
    "You know what the best part of today was? I got the chance to fall in love with you all over again.",
    "All right, you're going the right way for a smack bottom.",
    "This is the part where you run away.",
    "I like my privacy.",
    "Roar!",
    "Once upon a time, there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep, in the highest room of the tallest tower, for her true love and true love's first kiss… like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of…",
    "Wow! Let's do that again!",
    "Only a true friend would be that truly honest.",
    "Because that's what friends do, they FORGIVE EACH OTHER!",
    "This'll be fun. We'll stay up late, swapping manly stories, and in the morning… I'm making waffles!",
    "I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder.",
    "Don't you want to tell me about your trip? How about a game of Parcheesi?",
    "Please! I don't wanna go back there. You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak… well, maybe you do, but that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay!",
    "Wow, that was really scary, and if you don't mind me saying, if that don't work, your breath will certainly get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something 'cause your breath STINKS.",
    "It's gonna be champagne wishes and caviar dreams from now on.",
    "Man, you gotta warn somebody before you crack one like that. My mouth was open and everything.",
    "And then one time I ate some rotten berries. Man, there were some strong gases eeking outta my butt that day.",
    "Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Man, this would be so much easier if I wasn't color blind!",
    "Wake up and smell the pheromones.",
    "Before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy. Look at my eye twitchin'.",
    "Huh, celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?",
    "Oh, what large teeth you have. I mean, white sparkly teeth. I know you probably hear this all the time from your food, but you must bleach or something, 'cause that's one dazzling smile you got there. And do I detect a hint of minty freshness?",
    "She called me a noble steed.",
    "You, uh, you don't entertain much, do you?",
    "That's another thing we have in common. I hate it when you've got someone in your face, you try to give someone a hint and they won't leave, and then there's that big awkward silence, you know?",
    "Oh! Pick me! Pick me! Me! Me! Meeee!",
    "Don't mess wit' me. I'm the Stair Master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here, I could step here and here and here and step all over it.",
    "Eat me!",
    "You're a monster.",
    "Don't tell him anything!",
    "No, not the buttons… not my gumdrop buttons!",
    "OK… I'll tell you. Do you know the Muffin Man?",
    "Well, she's married to the Muffin Man.",
    "It's ALIVE!",
    "I hate these ball shows. They bore me to tears! Flip over to Wheel of Torture.",
    "It looks like we're up chocolate creek without a popsicle stick.",
    "Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man! We've got a big order to fill.",
    "Quick, rewind it!",
    "God bless us, everyone.",
    "Nobody said I have the right to remain silent!",
    "What's that? It's hideous!",
    "Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.",
    "Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.",
    "Whoa. Look at that. Who'd wanna live in a place like that?",
    "That would be my home.",
    "Good morning. Um, how do you like your eggs?",
    "Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy.",
    "I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy.",
    "What kind of a knight are you?",
    "One of a kind.",
    "Can I stay with you? Please?",
    "Of course.",
    "Really?",
    "NO.",
    "Yes, I know the muffin man. Who lives on Drury Lane?",
    "You didn't slay the dragon?",
    "It's on my to-do list. Now come on.",
    "Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?",
    "No, this is one of those drop it and leave it alone things.",
    "There's an arrow in your butt.",
    "I'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now tell me!",
    "He hoofed unt he poofed unt he... signed an eviction notice.",
    "You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings."
